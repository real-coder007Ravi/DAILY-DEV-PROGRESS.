      A <b>blockchain</b> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records
      (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic
      hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the
      previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented
      as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each
      block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form
      a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block
      linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are
      irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block
      cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
      Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network
      for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to
      a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks.
      Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks
      are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify
      a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5] A
      blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or
      pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed
      ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by
      Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The implementation of
      the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve
      the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or
      central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2]
      and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by
      cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment
      rail.[7] Private blockchains have been proposed for business use.
      Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without
      a proper security model "snake oil";[8] however, others have argued that
      permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized
      and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.[4][9]

    <h2>History</h2>

      Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his
      1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted
      by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work on a cryptographically
      secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
      Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted to implement a system wherein document
      timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave
      Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its
      efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into
      one block.[4][12] Under their company Surety, their document certificate
      hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since
      1995.[13]
